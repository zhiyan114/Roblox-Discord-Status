## software
There are some software you need. They might be proprietary or open-source
* Synapse X (Proprietary) - This software will be used to read information about your roblox game. The **Exploit.lua** should be under auto-execute for the maximum convenient.

## Warning
Synapse X is a software that allows to modify Roblox client in realtime as if developer intended the behavior and because of that, it violates roblox terms of condition. Some game also detects those modification (which this script shouldn't be affected because it doesn't modify in-game content). If your planning to use it, play on your alt account.
